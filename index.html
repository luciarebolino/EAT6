  Considering humans as the invasive species in an environment where the boundary between the visible and invisible dimensions of space no longer exists.
The project investigates phenomena and mechanisms of the interaction between human and non-human animals through visual narrative, animated and cinematic techniques.
<br></br>
With the development of new technologies, human beings have invaded and occupied the natural electromagnetic spectrum of earth, which provides essential cues to many species, specifically marine animals who use electromagnetic fields in locating resources, communication, and finding mates…
<br></br>
Considering the spectrum as intangible finite space, humans become invaders of a space they cannot see. In fact, humans and non-human animals interact in the electromagnetic spectrum through different mediums.
<br></br>
How technology is displayed in the natural environment?
Are non-humans animals sensitive to this spectrum?
How can we visualize these invisible interactions in the environment?
Can organisms sense and act differently depending on the specific electromagnetic environment? 
<br></br>
Taking the example of magnetic bacteria's response to the weak magnetic fields naturally present on earth, we test and visualize how our daily use of technologies could alter the behavior of the natural world around us.
“Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are found in almost all types of aquatic environments. They consist of a nano-sized crystal of a magnetic iron mineral that is enveloped by a lipid bilayer membrane. In cells of almost all MTB, magnetosomes are organized as a well-ordered chain. The magnetosome chain causes the cell to behave like a motile, miniature compass needle where the cell aligns and swims parallel to magnetic field lines.”
<br></br>
Project mapping is used to visualize this disturbance in the natural environment. To generate the interaction, we code a script in TouchDesigner that allows clusters of particles to move in relation to a camera that senses human movement in space. Particles are the abstraction of the bacteria moving in the water, their natural movement follow the natural magnetic field. Once humans interact with technology, the particles react, changing their natural flow into new behaviour.
To display the bacteria in the water, we experiment with a different solvent that allows the creation of an opaque layer. Thanks of this, the human (hand) can immerse totally in the bacteria environment, in the invisible habitat of the bacteria, and disappear within a space they are not able to see.
At the very core of this interaction is the animal’s ability to understand the electromagnetic environment through its sensory biology, which is altered because of humans.
<br></br>
People interacting with the water and the bacteria will perceive with different senses, both tactically and visually, the invisible electromagnetic spectrum that they unconsciously invade and realize how their impact (touch) could change the space at different scales and dimensions (visible and not visible).
